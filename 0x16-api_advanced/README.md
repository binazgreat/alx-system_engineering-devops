0x16-api_advanced
In this I have been exercising using API with pagiantion, parsing JSON results from an API, making a recursive API call and sorting a dictionary by value.
Task 0 - Write a function that queries the Reddit API and returns the number of subscribers (not active users, total subscribers) for a given subreddit. If an invalid subreddit is given, the function should return 0.
Task 1 - Write a function that queries the Reddit API and prints the titles of the first 10 hot posts listed for a given subreddit.
Task 2 - Write a recursive function that queries the Reddit API and returns a list containing the titles of all hot articles for a given subreddit. If no results are found for the given subreddit, the function should return None.
Task 3 - Write a recursive function that queries the Reddit API, parses the title of all hot articles, and prints a sorted count of given keywords (case-insensitive, delimited by spaces. Javascript should count as javascript, but java should not).
