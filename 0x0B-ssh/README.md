0x0B-ssh
In this project I am going to perform tasks related to server, SSH, SSH RSA key pair and connecting a remote host.
Task 0 - Write a Bash script that uses ssh to connect to your server using the private key ~/.ssh/school with the user ubuntu.
Task 1 - Write a Bash script that creates an RSA key pair.
Task 2 - SSH client configuration
Task 3 - Add the SSH public key below to your server so that we can connect using the ubuntu user.
